## Milestone 1 Feedback
Excellent work on defining the direction for your PWP. Your purpose, audience, goal(s), Persona and Use Case are all thoughtfully crafted and very well defined. You demonstrate a very high level of understanding 
regarding your chosen career trajectory and the interests and needs of the end-users you plan to target. I'm looking forward to seeing what content and UI design ideas you come up with in Milestone 2a, especially in regards to your areas of interest.

Your HTML looks great, and your project is set up according to specifications. Nice work. Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to begin work on [Milestone 2&alpha;](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two/).
