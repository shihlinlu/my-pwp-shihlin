## Milestone 1 Feedback
Excellent work on defining the direction for your PWP. Your purpose, audience, goal(s), Persona and Use Case are all thoughtfully crafted and very well defined. You demonstrate a very high level of understanding 
regarding your chosen career trajectory and the interests and needs of the end-users you plan to target. I'm looking forward to seeing what content and UI design ideas you come up with in Milestone 2a, especially in regards to your areas of interest.

Your HTML looks great, and your project is set up according to specifications. Nice work. Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to begin work on [Milestone 2&alpha;](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two/).

# Milestone 2&alpha; Feedback

Great job clearly outlining each section of your PWP, and matching the wireframe accordingly. I like the clean layout, and logical structure. I also like that you'll be showcasing some of your previous blog entries and articles. I think that'll show potential employers/clients that you're more than just a developer.

According to [W3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fbootcamp-coders.cnm.edu%2F~slu5%2Fmy-pwp-shihlin%2Fepic%2Fpublic_html%2Fdocumentation%2Fmilestone-2.php) you have no warnings or errors, which is awesome! However, I did notice that you left out an important piece of the HTML puzzle, which is: `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">`. That `<meta>` tag is important for responsive development.

Overall your html is good and I think your PWP is going to come out looking great.

## grade Tier IV - Great job! https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/
